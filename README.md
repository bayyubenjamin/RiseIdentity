## Proof of Concept & Usage Screenshots

Below are several screenshots that demonstrate the successful minting process and the technical flow of the **Pharos Identity** project.

### 1. dApp Interface â€” Mint Identity NFT

*This screenshot displays the main interface of the Pharos Identity dApp. The user has successfully logged in with Google and connected their wallet. The interface confirms that the NFT Identity has already been minted, showing the wallet address, email, metadata link (IPFS), and transaction hash. This guarantees that each wallet/email can only mint one unique identity NFT.*

### 2. Blockchain Transaction Proof

*This screenshot is taken from the Pharos Testnet block explorer, showing the transaction details of the mint operation. It includes the transaction hash, status (success), involved wallet addresses, timestamp, block number, transaction fee, and gas usage. This serves as immutable proof on the blockchain that the NFT identity was minted.*

### 3. NFT Metadata on IPFS

*This screenshot demonstrates the actual metadata stored on IPFS, containing the NFT name, description, email hash, wallet address, and image URL. This ensures the identity is securely stored in a decentralized manner.*

## Summary

These screenshots provide clear evidence of the working system, from user interaction in the dApp, transaction verification on chain, to decentralized storage of identity metadata. This end-to-end flow highlights the transparency, security, and real-world usability of the **Pharos Identity** project.
