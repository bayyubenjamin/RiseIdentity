## Function, Purpose, and Benefits of the Pharos Identity Project

### Function
Pharos Identity is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables users to mint identity NFTs based on their email and wallet on the Pharos Testnet network. Each wallet can only own one identity NFT linked to the user's Google account, preventing duplication and maintaining the uniqueness of digital identities.

### Purpose
- Provide a unique, transparent, and secure blockchain-based digital identity solution.
- Make it easier for communities and developers to perform NFT-based identity verification within the Pharos ecosystem.
- Adopt web3 technology for identity usage in both real-world and decentralized application scenarios.

### Benefits
- Increase security and trust within the digital ecosystem, as each identity is unique and cannot be forged.
- Link conventional identities (email) with web3 wallets without storing sensitive data centrally.
- Support various use cases such as airdrops, whitelists, event verifications, or NFT identity-based rewards.
- Offer a seamless web3 onboarding experience through integration with Google login and popular crypto wallets.
