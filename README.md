## Proof of Concept & Usage Evidence

Below are several screenshots that demonstrate the successful minting process and the technical workflow of the **Pharos Identity** project.

### 1. dApp Interface — Minting Identity NFT

*This screenshot showcases the main interface of the Pharos Identity dApp. The user has successfully authenticated via Google and connected their wallet. The interface confirms that the NFT Identity has been minted, displaying key details such as the wallet address, email, metadata link (IPFS), and transaction hash. This mechanism ensures that each wallet/email is permitted to mint only a single, unique identity NFT.*

### 2. On-Chain Transaction Verification

*This screenshot, taken from the Pharos Testnet block explorer, illustrates the transaction details corresponding to the mint operation. It includes the transaction hash, status (success), involved wallet addresses, timestamp, block number, transaction fee, and gas usage. This serves as immutable, verifiable proof on the blockchain that the NFT identity was minted successfully.*

### 3. Decentralized NFT Metadata (IPFS)

*This screenshot displays the actual metadata hosted on IPFS, containing the NFT’s name, description, email hash, wallet address, and image URL. Leveraging IPFS ensures that identity data is securely stored in a decentralized, tamper-resistant manner.*

## Conclusion

These screenshots collectively provide clear evidence of the end-to-end Pharos Identity workflow: from user interaction in the dApp, on-chain transaction verification, to decentralized storage of identity metadata. This comprehensive flow showcases the transparency, security, and practical utility of the **Pharos Identity** project in a real-world testnet environment.
